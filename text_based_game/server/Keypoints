Got it! The game will focus on **immersive storytelling** rather than a strict point system. Players will progress naturally by interacting with characters, solving language-based puzzles, and making choices that influence the story.  

To reinforce **basic language learning**, we can integrate:  
- **Contextual Conversations:** Players must use simple Japanese phrases to advance the story.  
- **Item-Based Problem Solving:** Each item plays a role in unlocking new story elements.  
- **Branching Dialogues:** Choices will affect how characters respond, encouraging natural language use.  



Vocabulary prompts: After each action, display new words.
Grammar hints: If the player struggles, provide sentence hints.
Quizzes: Add checkpoints where they answer questions in Japanese.

NPCs will respond naturally to mistakes but won’t outright correct them.

Some interactions may fail if the player uses incorrect language, requiring them to try again.

Consequences will be realistic—e.g., ordering the wrong food, getting lost, or misunderstanding a clue.

 NPCs will be designed to be helpful and patient, gently guiding players instead of punishing mistakes
 
 If a player makes a mistake, NPCs might rephrase their response instead of outright rejecting it.

Some characters might provide subtle context clues to help players self-correct.

Wrong answers won’t block progress entirely—players can always retry or find alternative ways to proceed.

game is **story-driven** and focused on **basic language learning**, the puzzles should be immersive and encourage natural interaction with Japanese.
