## Development

### Project Structure

```
backend-lang-portal/
├── main.py              # Application entry point
├── models.py            # SQLAlchemy models
├── schemas.py           # Pydantic schemas
├── database.py          # Database configuration
├── repositories.py      # Data access layer
├── config.py           # Application configuration
└── routes/             # API endpoints
    ├── word_routes.py
    ├── groups_routes.py
    └── study_session_routes.py
```

### Database Management

The application uses SQLite as its database. The database file is created automatically when running `create_tables.py`.

### Adding New Features

1. Define models in `models.py`
2. Create schemas in `schemas.py`
3. Implement repository methods in `repositories.py`
4. Add routes in the appropriate route file under `routes/`

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables and the `.env` file:

```env
APP_NAME=FastAPI App
DEBUG=False
VERSION=1.0.0
API_PREFIX=/api/v1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./sql_app.db
```

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access:

- Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI): `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Alternative API documentation (ReDoc): `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
